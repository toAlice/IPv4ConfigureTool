# IPv4 Settings Switch

A very simple program writen in Qt 5.12. It provides GUI tools to help you fast switching between different IPv4 settings on different Interfaces.

## Compile
### MinGW
```
qmake && mingw32-make 
```

## Known Issue
Interface names can only use ASCII characters. You can rename the interfaces in `Windows Settings -> Network & internet -> Change Adapter Options`
